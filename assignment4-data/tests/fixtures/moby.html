          Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
          these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
          shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
          blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,
          after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still
          retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being
          now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and
          bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new
          shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.
